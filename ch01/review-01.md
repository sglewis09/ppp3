g Review for chapter 1

1. What is the purpose of the "Hello, World!" program?
   1. It is an example C++ program that illustrates how to output the string
   "Hello World!" to the screen.
1. Name the four parts of a function.
   1. A *return type*, where specifies what kind to result, if any, the
   function will return to whoever asked for it to be executed.
   1. A *name*.
   1. A *parameter list* enclosed in parentheses.
   1. A *function body* enclosed in a set of "curly braces," `{ }` which lists
   the actions (called *statements*) that the function is to perform.
1. Name a function that must appear in every C++ program?
   1. `int main()`.
1. In the "Hello, World!" program, what is the purpose of the line `return 0`?
   1. `return 0` in int main() exists the program and returns 0 to indicate
   that no error has occurred.
1. What is the purpose of the compiler?
   1. It converts c++ source code into object files that can be linked with
   a linker to create an executable program.
1. What is the purpose of the `import` statement?
   1. It is used to import modules in a C++ program. Modules can reduce
   compilation times, by preprocessing #includes and other directives.
1. What is the purpose of the `#include` directive?
   1. To load header files that define declarations for functions from
   libraries.
1. What does a `.cpp` suffix at the end of a file name signify in C++?
   1. The file is C++ source code that is compiled into object files that
   are then linked into an executable program.
1. What does the linker do for your program?
   1. It links together one or more object files (with an .o extension in
   Linux) into an executable program or library file.
1. What is the difference between a source file and and object file?
   1. Source files are text files that contain human readable C++ code. Object
   files are created by a compiler. They contain machine code that runs on
   a computer's CPU.
1. What is an executable?
   1. It is a computer file that run on a computer. It contains machine code
   targetted for a computer's CPU and consists of binary numbers that
   represent instructions that the CPU runs.
1. What is an IDE and what does it do for you?
   1. IDE stands for "Integrated Development Environment". IDEs usually let
   edit code, debug and run finishe programs. They call on a compiler and
   linker to build finished programs. Most of them use colors and font styles
   to high syntax and perform static error checking to insure that your
   program will compile.
1. How do you get a compiled program to run?
   1. That differs by operating systems, and development environments. IDEs
   usually have a 'Run' button or menu selection that builds any modified
   source files and runs the completed program.
   1. When using a text editor, started from the command-line, you need
   compile and link the source code files into a finished program. Most
   programs that are made up of multible source files are built with a special
   build program that uses a make file to (re)build object files for any
   changed source code files and then link them.
1. What is a comment?
   1. Text that is placed between `/*` and `*/` or after `//` in the source
   code as notes to the programmer.
1. What is the purpose of a drill?
   1. Drills are simple programming tasks that should be performed on a
   computer. They reinforce the concepts taught in the text.
1. If you understand everything in the textbook, why is it necessary to
   practice?
   1. Practicing writing, and building programs helps to reinforce what
   is being taught. It also gives a programmer valuable experience with
   testing and debuggin finished code to make sure that it functions as
   intended.
