# README for `sglewis09/ppp3`

This repository contains my implementation of the Drills, Examples, and
Exercises from "Programming Principles and Practices Using C++ - Third Edition"
by Bjarne Stroustrup

The examples are taken from the book.

They currently don't use modules.

All of this code is copied or created for the purpose of learning about
writing programs in C++.

There is no warantee that these programs are correctly implemented or that
they actually do what they claim to do. Use them at your own risk.
